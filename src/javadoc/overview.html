			A Hierarchical Mapping File Format 
			<br>
			This library provides a recursive key-value interpretation for your configuration files, with comment support.
			<br>
			The goal of HMFF is to provide a configuration file with the end user in mind.<br>
			End users need comments and may not be familiar with concepts like encapsulation, escaping, data types or complex data structures.<br>
			HMFF keeps it simple while staying flexible. Any text based input will have a valid HMFF interpretation.
